### Whatsapp-Group-Chat-Analysis-using-NLP.

The respository analyze the whatsapp text which produces a Solution words percentage of the group conversation.

#Step 3: Creating Virtual Environment
After the installation of Anaconda, type Anaconda prompt in the windows search bar

1. Anaconda Prompt --> Right Click --> Run as Administrator 

2. conda create -n <project name>
Example: conda create -n nlp

3.After this step closes the Anaconda Prompt.

4. Again open

Anaconda Prompt --> Click
$(base)D:\er\# activate nlp
(nlp)D:\er\# pip install numpy
(nlp)D:\er\# pip install nltk
(nlp)D:\er\# pip install chardet
(nlp)D:\er\# pip install pandas
(nlp)D:\er\# pip install matplotlib
(nlp)D:\er\# pip install spyder=3.2.3 (This will install Python 3.6.8)


#Step 4: Run interested python code(with emoji, without emoji)

##Output of the program

1. Active messenger in a chat
2. Least active messenger in a chat
3. Solution words used by each
4. Solution percentage for each
5. Email and Links Retrieval
6. Extract the Number of documents Shared(PDF, Exsl, PPT, Docx)
7. Most frequently used Emojis

#Conclusion:
